# WSF Schedule Project

Coffee Stand Kiosk

## How it's built

We are using the `oak` module to start our app. The current stack is

* express (for local Server)
* stylus (for CSS)
* pug (for Markup)
* angular

## Get the app ready

You need to have node installed on your system, we are currently using the same version as [oak](https://github.com/oaklabsinc/oak).

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the app

Now you can run the UI

```bash
npm start
```
